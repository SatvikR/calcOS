An embedded operating system for the RP2040 that does calculus. Uses a TFT display driven by the ILI3941.

## Todo list

- [x] ILI3941 driver
- [x] High level API for TFT
- [ ] Barebones GFX API
- [ ] Text rendering
- [ ] Math symbol rendering
- [ ] Buttons
- [ ] Typing
- [ ] Implement algorithms for basic math functions
- [ ] Barebones math repl
- [ ] More functions?
- [ ] Menus?
- [ ] Graphing?
- [ ] Replace repl with ti-style apps?
- [ ] Utilize color?

> "?" indicates that I'm not sure if I want to implement it or I'm not sure if I'll have time/energy to implement it.
